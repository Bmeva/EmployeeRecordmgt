Whether to write your own UI with HTML and CSS or use a pre-built UI component library like Material-UI (MUI) in a React project depends on several factors, including the project's requirements, timelines, and the team's expertise. Here are some considerations to help you decide which approach might be better for your situation:

Benefits of Writing Your Own UI
Customization and Control:

Tailored Design: You have complete control over the look and feel of the UI, allowing for a unique design that matches your brand exactly.
Flexibility: Custom UI allows you to implement specific functionalities and design patterns that might not be supported by a library.
Performance Optimization:

Lightweight: By creating only the components you need, you can keep the codebase minimal and avoid the overhead of unused features in a library.
Specific Use Cases: Optimize the UI for particular scenarios or devices, leading to potentially better performance.
Learning and Expertise:

Skill Development: Building UI components from scratch can deepen your team's understanding of CSS, HTML, and modern CSS frameworks (e.g., CSS Grid, Flexbox).
Problem Solving: Custom development requires solving unique design challenges, which can enhance the team's problem-solving abilities.
Avoiding Library Lock-In:

Independence: You are not tied to the updates or changes of a third-party library, which may introduce breaking changes over time.
Long-Term Stability: Custom code can remain consistent over the project's lifespan without the need to track library updates.
Benefits of Using a UI Library
Speed of Development:

Rapid Prototyping: Libraries provide pre-built components that can be quickly integrated into projects, speeding up the development process.
Reduced Boilerplate: With many common UI elements already available, you can focus on developing business logic rather than basic UI elements.
Consistency and Best Practices:

Design Consistency: Libraries like MUI ensure a consistent design language across components, reducing the design burden on developers.
Accessibility: Reputable libraries often adhere to accessibility standards, ensuring that components are usable by people with disabilities.
Community and Support:

Documentation and Examples: UI libraries usually come with comprehensive documentation and community support, making it easier to resolve issues.
Active Development: Libraries are often maintained by dedicated teams who keep the components up-to-date with the latest web standards.
Responsive Design:

Built-In Responsiveness: Many libraries include responsive design features that work well across different devices without additional configuration.

You're correct that the code you've written uses JSX syntax, but it's still completely valid to have it in a file with the .js extension. Here's how it works:

JSX in .js Files:

React projects often include JSX code inside files with the .js extension. Modern development setups (like those using Babel and Webpack) are configured to recognize JSX syntax within .js files and transpile it appropriately.
So, even though JSX is technically a syntax extension of JavaScript, it's common and perfectly acceptable to use it within files named with the .js extension.
.jsx vs. .js:

.jsx: This is more explicit and indicates that the file contains JSX syntax. It's a convention that some developers prefer to make it clear that the file isn't just plain JavaScript but includes React components with JSX.
.js: This is more general and can contain plain JavaScript, JSX, or a mix of both. Most React projects use .js for all files, including those with JSX.
So, to summarize:

Your file named skill.js is correctly using JSX syntax, and there's no issue with that.
If your development environment is set up correctly (which is typically the case in modern React projects), it will handle JSX in .js files without any problem.

In a React project, it's common to mix files with different extensions, such as .js, .jsx, and .tsx, and they can work together seamlessly. Here's why your .tsx file (navbar.tsx) works well with your .js files:

Understanding the Extensions
.js (JavaScript):

These files contain standard JavaScript. They can include JSX syntax if you're working in a React environment. Most React projects are set up to handle JSX within .js files using tools like Babel.
.jsx (JavaScript with JSX):

These files are similar to .js files but explicitly indicate that they contain JSX syntax. It's just a convention to clarify that the file has JSX, but it's not strictly necessary for functionality.
.tsx (TypeScript with JSX):

These files are used in projects that incorporate TypeScript. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language, which can catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime.
.tsx files can contain both TypeScript and JSX syntax, allowing you to define typed React components.
How They Work Together
Compatibility: TypeScript (.tsx files) is fully compatible with JavaScript (.js or .jsx files). You can import and use components written in .js files inside .tsx files and vice versa.

Transpilation: In a typical React project using TypeScript, the build setup (e.g., using tools like Webpack, Babel, and TypeScript compiler tsc) is configured to transpile both .js and .tsx files into JavaScript that the browser can execute. This makes it possible for the different file types to coexist and interact smoothly.

Interoperability:

You can import .tsx components into .js files and use them as you would with any other React component.
Similarly, components written in .js or .jsx files can be imported and used in .tsx files without issues.
Conclusion
Your project is set up correctly to allow files with different extensions to work together. The .tsx file works well with your .js files because React, TypeScript, and the surrounding tooling (like Babel and Webpack) are designed to handle these different file types seamlessly.

There's no need to worry about mixing .js and .tsx filesâ€”they are meant to be interoperable in modern React projects.

The file extension .jst typically refers to JavaScript Template files, which are used for client-side templating. These templates allow developers to write HTML structures with placeholders that can be dynamically filled with data.

Common Uses of .jst Files:
Client-Side Templating:

JavaScript Templates: .jst files can contain HTML templates with embedded JavaScript expressions or variables that are replaced with actual data when the template is rendered in the browser.
Libraries like Underscore.js or Lodash have historically used .jst files for templating, though modern frameworks (like React, Vue, or Angular) often render .jst unnecessary as they incorporate templating within their components.
Static HTML Generation:

.jst files can also be used in static site generators or build processes where HTML files are generated dynamically based on data or configuration. The .jst file acts as a template, and during the build process, it gets converted into a standard .html file with the data populated.
Server-Side Usage:

In some server-side environments, .jst files might be used as templates that are rendered by the server before sending the final HTML to the client.
How .jst Files Compare to Other File Extensions:
.js: Contains plain JavaScript or JavaScript with JSX in a React environment.
.jsx: Similar to .js but explicitly used for files that contain JSX.
.tsx: Used for TypeScript files that also include JSX syntax, common in TypeScript-based React projects.
.html: Standard HTML files that define the structure of web pages.
.jst: Templates with embedded JavaScript for dynamic content generation.
Conclusion:
.jst is a specialized extension used for JavaScript templates, particularly in projects or environments where templating is separate from the main JavaScript logic. It's less common in modern web development due to the rise of frameworks that integrate templating directly into components.



Both fetch and axios are capable of making HTTP requests in React applications, but axios 
provides more features and a simpler syntax. It's especially useful when you need to handle HTTP
 requests with more complex configurations, 
error handling, or when you want to globally manage request and response processing.
